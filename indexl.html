</br>
</br>

There are many ways to solve a level, and clues may be hidden in unusual places. The answers themselves can be used in different ways and can be typed inside or outside the game window : 
</br>
</br>
- Some clues are optional but others are needed to understand the riddle. To see the clue of the riddle just click on the "clue" button under the game window. But this isn't always the only clue you can find... The page title and/or the names of the files used in the level might often be useful. 
</br>
</br>
- Some clues can be hidden in pictures or sounds. You'll need softwares to solve some levels but there is nothing you can't do with free ones. Check the "Open-source softwares" paragraph in this page to see and get what you might need to play the game. 
</br>
</br>
- You will not always have a text box or a button to press to solve a level. Some answers have to be typed directly in the address bar of your browser. For example : if you are in a level named white.html and if a clue tells you to go to the opposite level, you can directly replace white.html by black.html in the address bar to see what happens. And if you need to download a file named color.jpg you can also replace white.html by color.jpg to access the picture. 
</br>
</br>
- Be patient, avoid the spoilers if you don't want to ruin your game experience. You don't need to be a scientist or a computer specialist to play this game. You only need to spend some time to understand the riddle and to use google to learn what you don't know yet (the search engine is inside some of the clue pages).
