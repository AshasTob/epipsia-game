# epipsia-game
### - TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO PLAY QUEST: DO NOT READ THE PROJECT CODE/STRUCTURE. IT MAY RUIN YOUR EXPERIENCE - ###
Preliminary version of an html riddle-based quest.
Created in 2013 by me, as a bored student, dreaming about video-games development.

This game is fully inspired by http://www.ouverture-facile.com/start/ .
Epipsia game inherits logic and quest-design from ouverture-facile, at the same time being product of my creativity.
